    <h2>Sinangag or Garlic Fried Rice has been a favorite part of every Filipino breakfast. Sinangag can go well with many dishes regardless if these are fried dishes or stews. I personally like to have sinangag with fried salted dried fish such as tuyo, daing, and danggit. Of course, sinangag is also best with tapa, tocino, longganisa, and corned beef.

    <p>I used to eat Filipino Garlic Fried rice for breakfast most of the time. I like it with lots of toasted garlic on top. This was the reason why I needed to brush my teeth twice after the meal.</p>

    <p>There are days where I get very lazy, but still crave for this dish. I usually do a shortcut by just mixing leftover rice with toasted garlic ( I regularly keep toasted garlic in the fridge sealed in a jar just in case I will need it), add a bit of oil and mix everything, and then cook it in the microwave. The place will smell like garlic so make sure you have proper ventilation in the house.
